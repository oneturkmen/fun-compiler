# Compiler front-end for the Decaf Language

Decaf is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language with support for inheritance and encapsulation. It is very similar to Java, but less so (you can treat it as a language for learning-only purposes).

Built lexical analyzer, parser, type checker for the *Compiler Construction I* class at University of Wyoming.
